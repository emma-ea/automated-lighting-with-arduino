Using Light Dependent Resistor to Control LEDs

## Getting LEDs to turn ON or OFF using LDR (photoresistor)
LDR work by decreases resitance with respect to receiving luminosity on the LDR's sensitive surface.

The microcontroller on the arduino board is programmed to turn the LED on or off depending on how much light hits the surface of 

the photoresistor.

In turn it regulates how bright LED gets.

## Applications 
Applications include getting Lights to turn on or off when its dark.
