# Automated-Lighting-With-Arduino
Using Light Dependent Resistor to Control LEDs

## Getting LEDs to turn ON or OFF using LDR (photoresistor)
LDR work by decreases resitance with respect to receiving luminosity on the LDR's sensitive surface.

The microcontroller on the arduino board is programmed to turn the LED on or off 
depending on how much light hits the surface of the photoresistor.

In turn it regulates how bright LED gets.

## Applications 
Applications include getting Lights to turn on or off when its dark in a room.

## Files
The project files include the code( <b>surprising_bigery1.ino</b> ) and a simulated model( <b>surprising_bigery.brd</b> ) which i made from <a href="tinkercard.com">tinkercad.com</a>. Its a free platform which i use for prototyping my arduino projects before i get my hands dirty.

To test the simulation. You'll need an account from <a href="tinkercard.com">tinkercad.com</a> if you already don't have one. Import the <i>.brd</i> file and run
